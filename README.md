# IPFS_Network
CAPSTONE IPFS Project
  -This IPFS network is a peer to peer network where each node of the network is in charge of a block of a file. When one Node creates a file, it splits the content of that file into several blocks and gives a block to a single node. If any node of the network wants to read the file, they must recieve the block information from the other nodes in the network. Once they have all the blocks they can rebuild the file and read it.
  -The IPFS network can only process write and read commands.
  -The NFS is a smaller version of the IPFS. The NFS only deals with 1 server and 1 client. The server handles and manages the filesystem and sends information to the client.
