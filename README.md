  This IPFS network is a peer to peer network where each node is in charge of a block of data. When one Node creates a file, it splits the content of that file into several blocks and distributes it throughout the Network. Every node will have a block of the file, if a node wishes to read the file they must send a request the other nodes to send them the blocks it does not have.\
  This IPFS network can only issue write and read commands.\
  The NFS is a smaller version of the IPFS. The NFS only deals with 1 server and 1 client. The server handles and manages the filesystem and sends information to the client.
